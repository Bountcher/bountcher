**We are changing the future of work and solving today's labor market challenges.**

## Labor Market Challenges

The current labor market faces a pay gap, discrimination, inequality, and more problems.

### Pay Gap

US-based and European companies hire people from cheaper destinations. The same job title is paid differently in different countries, cities, and organizations. People are paid based on the cost of living or their nationality. Many people don't know how much money is accurate to their position because it's not transparent, and it's a taboo topic.

There are many international platforms for freelancers where they can find a job, client, or project. In many of them, the price is the main deciding factor - the cheaper wins.

#### How Do We Solve It?

The platform has an hour rate/salary recommendation feature for each position. When the hour rate/salary is lower than the recommendation, there will be a warning, and the bounty creator will be penalized (worst position in the search, for example).

### Gender Inequality

Nowadays, the market faces gender inequality from both sides, even if it may not seem like this. The problem is that the same position is not paid equally to men and women. But nothing has been changing so far. Women are often not seen in tech and management positions because it's considered a "man thing." Sometimes women are hired to these positions to fulfill the quotas, which can lead to rejecting a man who might have suited the position better.

### Discrimination In General

Besides the gender inequality and pay gap, there are many more - religion, racism, university degrees/prestige, wealth, lifestyle, or appearance.

#### How Do We Solve It?

Everyone register to the platform via their wallet. No personal information is required to start working or creating bounties. It also solves the gender inequality problem.

### Equality & Partnership

Companies often see people they work with like their property. They have their own rules, which all the people must follow, but God forbid people have any requirements of their own. Companies don't care about peoples' lives and personal needs. There is the same metric for each employee and no space for negotiation. People often cannot work for their clients or on side projects or even talk about it in front of their colleagues. It feels like companies and employees are not equal - they aren't partners.

#### How Do We Solve It?

The platform has the same rules for bounty creators and workers. Also, the rules set in the bounty apply to both parties - the creator and the worker.

## Defaulter Problem

Many entrepreneurs and freelancers face a problem with defaulters. They have their job done, but their partner doesn't communicate, doesn't want to pay the invoice, or pays late.

### How Do We Solve It?

The platform has a treasury mechanism feature. The bounty creator must pay the total price (or at least some part) during the bounty creation process. When the worker resolves the bounty, they receive the revenue. It's not possible to withdraw the treasury when the bounty is not closed or rejected.

## Transparency

As we mentioned, money is taboo, and people don't talk about it. Salaries are not transparent, and companies keep them a secret.

### How Do We Solve It?

The platform has transparent hour rates/salaries for each position. It has a section for salary education, trends, and popularization - it breaks the taboo.

Also, the project has transparent fees, source code, and communication.

## Revenue Politics

The platform supports `SOL` and `USDC` tokens at the beginning. There will be support for more tokens in the future, but we will carefully select each of them. The reason is better user experience and trustworthiness.
